*This privacy policy has been adapted from Neil Kidd's site "I've been thinking" https://kidd.org.uk/privacy/, which I felt was a good policy, similar to what I want to cover. I am not a lawyer, but I believe the following policy to be an honest description of the this site and the data collected, in lines with what is required to comply with GDPR.*
