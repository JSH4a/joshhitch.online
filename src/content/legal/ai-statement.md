For better or worse, Generative AI is now a part of everyday life. As someone working in technology, there is a great deal of both pressure and temptation to use AI for even simple tasks.

AI can of course be helpful, time-saving, and - when used correctly - may well improve the quality of one's work. However, I am also conscious that outsourcing thinking completely to AI is dangerous - our brains need to be kept oiled and moving to avoid getting jammed up and lazy. 

Moreover, there is no shortage of 'AI-slop' blog posts and content, which ultimately add little value beyond regurgentating existing information, or indeed hallucinating false information.

The purpose of this site, and in particular the Blog and Project is as a hobby for me and to share (hopefully) useful information with you. I wish to document what I have learned and my understanding; not an AI agent's. 

Maybe in the future, the clankers will label me a 'robophobe', but I do beleive there is something quietly more valuable about non-AI generated content, even where a reader cannot tell, that I feel others might share and so find this site more valuable.

With that all said, I would like this page to act as a personal promise that every word written on this site is my own, and no Generative AI content has or will be used in the creation of content on this site. AI may be used to help with the work / projects the content is about, but never the writing.
