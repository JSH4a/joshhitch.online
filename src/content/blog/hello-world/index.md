Hello, world!

Welcome to my blog, where I will be chronicling my descent into the scary worlds of work and technology.

I will be sharing some of my experiences and thoughts, which I hope may be valuable to someone at some point. Either way I will end up with a nice log of important steps and lessons acquired from my journey for me.

I would like to first note two things about this blog and site:

1. I will not be using any Generative-AI tools for content on this site. You can read my [AI statement](legal/ai-statement) for detailed reasons, but TLDR; the point of this blog is to help me learn, and provide you with information I have myself found helpful from my own experiences - not ChatGPT's.

2. I do not claim to be the source of all truth and knowledge, and will undoubtedly make mistakes. I have a full disclaimer on this in my [Terms of Service](/legal/terms), but basically bare with me - I promise I will do my best.

If you would like to share your own thoughts, ask any questions, point out a typo, or just want to say hello, please do get in touch with me at hello@joshuahitchon.com.

I am looking forward to getting writing, and hopefully hearing from you!

\- Josh
